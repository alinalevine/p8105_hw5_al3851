Problem 1
=========

Create Dataframe
----------------

I am first making a tibble with one column that consists of the file name for each person. then I am mapping over each file name and am applying the read\_csv function, which will give me a list with the value each week for each person. I will replace give with "con" in the file name the value of "control" for group and all other people will get experimental.

``` r
study_df = 
  tibble(file = str_c("./Data/exp_con/", list.files("./Data/exp_con"))) %>%
  mutate(data = map(.x = file, read_csv)) %>%
  bind_rows %>%
  unnest() %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse( str_detect(file, "./Data/exp_con/con_[0-9][0-9].csv"), 
                        "control", 
                        "experimental")) %>%
  mutate(subj_id = str_replace_all(file,"[^0-9]","")) %>%
  gather(key = "week", value = "value", week_1:week_8) %>%
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "week_","")) %>%
  mutate( week = as.numeric(week))
```

Outcome Spaghetti Plot
----------------------

``` r
  ggplot(study_df, aes(x = week, y = value, color = group)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = interaction(group, subj_id))) +
  labs(title = "Outcome Over 8 Week Period")
```

The value for people in the experimental groups tends to increase over time, while the value for people in the control group does not increase over time.

Problem 2
=========

Homicide Data Import
--------------------

``` r
homicide_df = read_csv("./Data/homicide-data.csv")
```

There were a total of 52179 recorded homicides and there are 12 columns. Data is collected for the reported date, name of the victim, age of the victim, sex of the victim, the race of the victim, the city of the murder with latitude and longitude, and the status of the case.

Summary for each city
---------------------

``` r
homicide_city = homicide_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ",")) %>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(disposition = recode(disposition, `Closed without arrest` = "unsolved", `Open/No arrest` = "unsolved",    `Closed by arrest` = "solved")) %>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>%
  summarize(n_unsolved = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(total_homicides = sum(n_unsolved)) %>%
  filter(disposition == "unsolved")
```

Unsolved Murder Proportion Estimates
------------------------------------

First I am creating a dataframe that just has Baltimore murders and then I am estimating the proportion of murders that are unsolved and am getting a confidence interval using prop.test. The I am using map2 to get proportion estimates and confidence intervals for each city and am using map to tidy the list created by calling map2.

``` r
homicide_baltimore = homicide_city %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD")


balt_prop_test = homicide_baltimore %>%
  mutate(p_hat = list(broom::tidy(prop.test(n_unsolved, total_homicides)))) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)


city_unsolved = homicide_city %>%
  mutate(proportion_estimation = map2(.x = n_unsolved, .y = total_homicides, ~prop.test(.x,.y))) %>%
  mutate(proportion_estimation = map(.x = proportion_estimation, ~.x %>% broom::tidy(.x))) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Unsolved Murder Proportion Estimate Plot
----------------------------------------

``` r
city_unsolved %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot((aes(x = city_state, y = estimate))) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = .1) +
    geom_point() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
    labs(title = "Unsolved Murder Proportion By City",
         x = "City",
         y = "Proportion Estimate")
```

Chicago has the highest proportion of unsolved homicides and Richmond, Va has the lowest proportion of unsolved homicides.
